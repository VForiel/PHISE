# API References

PHISE include a core set of classes to model the main entities manipulated by the library and several modules providing additional functionalities.

The classes are nested as follows:
- Context
    - Interferometer
        - Telescope
        - KernelNuller
        - Camera
    - Target
        - Companion

As building such hierarchy of objects can be complex, please refer to the « Getting Started » guide for practical examples where you will get context templates based on VLTI and LIFE-like instruments.
