    "- The beam is then collimated by a first parabolic mirror and make an angle of 15Â° to align the beam with the table holes grid.\n",

    "- This almost-flat beam is focalised by a second miror on a third one placed just next to the ring.\n",
    "- This third mirror is then place in the focal plane and allow for simpler adjustments by slightly tweaking it's orientation rather than moving ll the previous and following elements.\n",
    "- The beam is then colimated again by a fourth mirror and goes on the second pupil plane where a segmented DM is placed.\n",
    "- This segmented DM will be used either to correct the wavefront and redirect the light such as we can control the flux that will pass through each holes in the next pupil mask."
